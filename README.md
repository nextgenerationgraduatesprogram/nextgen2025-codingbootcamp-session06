# NextGen Coding Bootcamp: Session 6

## :wave: Building Interactive Python Scripts

In this workshop we will explore how to create and use user-defined Python modules and build interactive scripts to improve the re-usability, modularity, and reproducbility of your code.


## :wrench: Setup

This workshop **requires** you to be running a Python environment locally such as using VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, or some other IDE. The notebooks will contain the necessary commands to install everything as we work through them.

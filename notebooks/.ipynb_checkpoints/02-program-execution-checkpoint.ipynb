    "When should we use scripts? Jupyter notebooks encourage tweaking and exploration, while this is an important part of the development process, we often get to a point where we just want to run the notebook from start to finish i.e. to perform some data processing. When the notebook is operating more as code we want to execute sequentially and repeatedly it's time to switch to scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a Python script? A Python script is a standalone file (.py) designed for sequential execution. Unlike modules, which are meant for organizing reusable code, scripts are executed directly. Scripts offer better maintainability, version control, performance, and automation, making them ideal for reproducible workflows and deployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What happens when you run a script? When a script runs, Python parses the code, compiles it to bytecode, and executes it within the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). This structured approach avoids issues like hidden states in notebooks and ensures predictable execution."
